This Python script utilizes the Tkinter library to create a simple file explorer GUI (Graphical User Interface). Here are the possibilities of this code:

1. File Explorer Window: The code creates a window using Tkinter, titled "File Explorer", with a specified size of 500x500 pixels and a white background color.

2. Browse Files Functionality: Upon clicking the "Browse Files" button, a file explorer window is opened, allowing the user to navigate through directories and select a file. The initial directory is set to the root directory ("/"). The user can select text files (*.txt) or all files.

3. Label Display: There is a label ("File Explorer using Tkinter") displayed at the top of the window, providing a description of the file explorer.

4. Label Update: Once a file is selected using the file explorer, the label's text is updated to show "File Opened: " followed by the selected file's path.

5. Exit Button: There is an "Exit" button provided, allowing the user to close the file explorer window and terminate the program.

6. Grid Layout: Widgets (label, buttons) are organized in a grid layout using the grid method, specifying their positions in terms of rows and columns within the window.

7. Event Handling: The script uses the mainloop() method to keep the window open and responsive to user interactions (button clicks, window close events) until the user decides to close the window.

Overall, this code provides a basic file explorer interface for users to browse and select files using Tkinter GUI components.
